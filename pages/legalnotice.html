          applicable media and telecommunication laws is the website operator
          listed above.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Nature of the service</h2>
        <p>
          Quizly is a web-based learning platform that allows registered users
          to generate and play quizzes based on YouTube videos. The quizzes are
          generated using automated transcription and AI-supported question
          generation.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Copyright and intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated, all content and materials on this website,
          including texts, graphics, logos, icons and design, are protected by
          copyright and other intellectual property laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any reproduction, distribution, modification or public display of the
          content requires the prior written consent of the respective rights
          holder, unless such use is expressly permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Use of YouTube content</h2>
        <p>
          Quizly itself does not provide or host any videos. Users may provide
          YouTube URLs in order to generate quizzes. The video content remains
          on YouTube and is subject exclusively to YouTube’s terms of use and
          the rights of the respective copyright holders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of YouTube content
          complies with the applicable terms and rights.
        </p>

        <h2>5. External links</h2>
        <p>
          This website may contain links to external sites from third parties.
          We have no influence on the content of these external websites.
          Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for such external content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible
          for the content of the linked pages. At the time of linking, no
          illegal content was recognisable on the linked pages. However, a
          permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not
          reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we
          become aware of any legal infringement, we will remove such links
          immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Liability for content</h2>
        <p>
          We take great care in creating the content on this website. However,
          we cannot guarantee that the content is complete, correct or
          up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on
          these pages in accordance with general laws. We are not obligated to
          monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to search
          for circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to
          remove or block the use of information under general laws remain
          unaffected.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Liability for technical availability</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to keep Quizly available without major interruptions.
          However, we cannot guarantee uninterrupted availability or freedom
          from errors. Temporary downtime may occur for technical reasons
          (maintenance, updates, server problems, etc.).
        </p>

        <h2>8. Dispute resolution / consumer information</h2>
        <p>
          If you are a consumer, you may have the right to use certain dispute
          resolution mechanisms according to your local jurisdiction. We are
          not obliged and generally not willing to participate in dispute
          resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board, unless
          required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Contact</h2>
