        <h1>Privacy Policy – Quizly</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> <!-- TODO: Update date --> 04 December 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Quizly</strong>. On this page we inform you about how we
          process personal data when you use our platform. This includes our
          website, the quiz application and all related services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Controller</h2>
        <p>
          The controller responsible for data processing on this website is:
        </p>
        <!-- TODO: Replace with your real contact details -->
        <p>
          <strong>Website Operator</strong><br />
          Leo Rullani <br />
          Untere Farnbühlstrasse 3<br />
          5610 Wohlen – Switzerland<br />
          E-mail: your.email@example.com
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data we process</h2>
        <p>We only process data that is necessary to provide and improve Quizly.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Account data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Username</li>
          <li>E-mail address</li>
          <li>Password (stored only as a salted and hashed value)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Usage and quiz data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Created quizzes (title, description, questions, answers)</li>
          <li>Associated YouTube URLs used to create quizzes</li>
          <li>Time of creation and updates of your quizzes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Technical data</h3>
        <p>
          When using Quizly, technical data may be processed automatically in
          order to provide the service securely and reliably. This can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>IP address (short-term for technical purposes)</li>
          <li>Browser type and version</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
          <li>Operating system and device information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Authentication and cookies</h2>
        <p>
          For authentication we use <strong>JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</strong>, which
          are stored as <strong>HTTP-only cookies</strong>. These cookies cannot be
          accessed via JavaScript and are used solely to keep you logged in.
        </p>
        <p>We use in particular:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>access_token</strong> – short-lived token for authentication</li>
          <li><strong>refresh_token</strong> – longer-lived token to obtain a new access token</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After logging out, these tokens are invalidated on the server side so
          that they can no longer be used.
        </p>

        <h2>5. YouTube and external services</h2>
        <h3>5.1 YouTube</h3>
        <p>
          Quizly allows you to create quizzes based on YouTube videos by
          entering a YouTube URL. The video itself is not stored by us. We
          download only the <strong>audio track</strong> of the video temporarily in
          order to create a transcript and generate quiz questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that YouTube is provided by Google Ireland Limited.
          The processing of data by YouTube is governed by YouTube’s own
          privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Audio processing and transcription</h3>
        <p>
          To extract and process the audio of a YouTube video, we use
          <strong>yt-dlp</strong> and <strong>FFmpeg</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For transcription of audio we use <strong>Whisper AI</strong>. In our setup
          Whisper is executed locally on the server. The audio and resulting
          transcript are used only to generate the quiz and are not shared with
          other users.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Quiz generation with Gemini</h3>
        <p>
          Quiz questions are generated using <strong>Gemini Flash</strong> (Google).
          For this purpose, the text transcript is sent to the Gemini API. The
          quiz (title, description, questions and answer options) is then
          stored in our database under your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of data by Google and Gemini is subject to Google's own
          privacy terms and API terms of use.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Purpose of data processing</h2>
        <p>We process your data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Generating quizzes based on YouTube content you provide</li>
          <li>Saving and displaying your created quizzes</li>
          <li>Ensuring the security and stability of the application</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          We store your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil
          the purposes described above or as required by law.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Account data is kept for the duration of your account’s existence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quizzes remain stored until you actively delete them or delete your
            account (if such a function is provided).
          </li>
          <li>
            Technical log data may be stored for a short period for security and
            error analysis.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Sharing of data</h2>
        <p>
          We generally do not share your personal data with third parties unless:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>you have given explicit consent,</li>
          <li>it is required by law or authorities, or</li>
          <li>
            it is technically necessary to use external services such as Gemini
            or YouTube (as described above).
          </li>
        </ul>

          We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect
          your personal data against loss, misuse and unauthorised access.
          However, no internet-based system can be completely secure, so we
          cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to adapt
